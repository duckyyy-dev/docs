## **Moderation Statement**

San Francisco Roleplay operates on an anti-bias, anti-racist, and anti-discriminatory policy. We **do not condone** **or encourage** behaviors that may make others feel uncomfortable and not welcome. We built a community that is safe for all players, no matter ethnicity, gender, or beliefs.

## **Moderation Policy**

Moderation actions are conducted at the staff members discretion. By joining our Discord and In-game community, you agree to abide by our regulations. Failure to abide by these regulations will result in moderation action against you.

How evidence is handled: Evidence from direct messages, whether a group chat or direct to another user, will not be taken into consideration when making a report, unless:

- The evidence was **collected while the user was actively employed** in the community **as a staff member**.
- The evidence is **not taken out of context**, and the user was **unprovoked**.
- The evidence is solid; **providing fake or misleading evidence will result in a ban** from California State Roleplay and it's affiliated servers.
- **Online dating is not permitted**, whether you are a community member, or a member of our staff team.
- Staff members must be at least **13 years old at the date of applying**. Staff members that are found to be under 13 will be swiftly removed from our team.
- Staff members may not advertise other communities in a status unless they are also including '.gg/sanfran' or something similar.

<Tip>
  The only time evidence from direct messages will be taken into consideration (even if the user is not a staff member) is if the user is advertising another community, or if the incident disrupts our normal operations.

## **Refund Policy**

San Francisco Roleplay does **not** provide refunds. By purchasing something from our Discord, Patreon, and Roblox store you agree to the following conditions:

- **Refunds will not be provided.**
- Leaving the community will result in a removal of the role you purchased.
- Community management may remove any perks whenever they would like, at their own discretion.

## **Extra**

"Our" referencing 1. San Francisco Roleplay and our affiliated servers and 2. The San Francisco Roleplay Staff Team.

It is impossible to fully eliminate everyday biases and discrimination, however we work as quick as possible to remove it from our community after it has been pointed out.
